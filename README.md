## 🎨 My Pookalam


### Description
Some designs bloom best when rooted in tradition, like my pookalam! 
This pookalam is a reminder of our beautiful tradition during Onam.
It is bright, colorful, and full of little details, a digital bloom created with code, yet carrying the same warmth as a floral carpet made by hand. Every petal in it has been placed with thought, and together they form not just a design, but a story of celebration.

The pookalam is placed on a green background, resembling the greenery of our land. Inside that greenery, the flowers are arranged within a brown circle, reminding us of the fading tradition of the cow dung base. On top of that, flowers bloom neatly in the form of another flower, making layers upon layers of beauty.

At the center, you can see 10 concentric circles — symbolising the 10 days of Onam (Atham to Thiruvonam) and the grand welcome of Maveli. The circles follow the traditional order of flowers: thumba at the center, just like the first day of Onam (as a white circle), then tulsi for the second day (the purple circle), and from the third day, Chothi onwards, red flowers are added,  just exactly as shown in my pookalam.

The inspiration for this whole work comes from the traditional pookalams I grew up seeing at home. I’m also glad I could include my knowledge of the significance of specific flowers for specific Onam days, something I first learned from social media and then brought alive in this design.

What I learned from this whole process is what makes this pookalam truly special for me. As someone who only knew bits and pieces of Python Turtle, I thought it would be a difficult task. But through the process, I discovered more than I expected, how to create intricate loops, how to manage designs step by step, and most importantly, how code can turn into culture. 🌺
